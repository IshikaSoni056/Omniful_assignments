<!-- 1. Normal Function -->
  A normal function is just a plain JavaScript function. You can use it anywhere â€” to do calculations, handle events, or return UI in functional components.

<!-- 2. Hook -->
  A hook is a special function provided by React (or custom-defined) that lets you tap into React features like state, lifecycle, or context inside functional components.

  Hooks must:
   Always start with the word use (e.g., useState, useEffect)
  Be called only inside React functional components or other hooks

  import { useState } from "react";

<!-- function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // useState is a hook

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Count: {count}
    </button>
  );
} -->
